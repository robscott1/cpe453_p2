1. Workloads that are increasing in run time will have the
   turnaround times in SRTN as FCFS because the jobs that arrive
   earlier will be continue to be completed in FIFO order.

2. Workloads of the same size, with a quantum of 1 will have
   the same response times between SRTN and RR.

3. The response times increase almost linearly. They will all have to
   wait longer for the shorter job to complete. But if all of the
   other jobs also have longer runtimes, the wait time will be added
   to all of the processes evenly

4. As the quantum increases, the response time will eventually plateau
   because every thread will just run to completion and then pass off
   the CPU to the next thread. Worst case response time would be when 
   each job completes before the next is chosen in Round Robin. If there
   are N jobs, then the newest job will have to wait N * L, where L is
   the length of each job in the collection of waiting jobs. This would
   also assume the the quantum is longer than any length of job, L.
